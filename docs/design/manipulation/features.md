 Selected features and their suggested importance

| Feature | Description | Importance |
| ------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Modular and configurable design | <ul><li> Highly customizable – can support variety of robots/manipulators </li><li> Modular – easy to replace implementations of parts with alternatives </li><li> Good defaults – less steep learning curve </li></ul> | Crucial |
| Core dynamics | <ul><li>Realistic movements for manipulation operations</li><li>Consider all the physics parameters involved in the manipulation operations</li></ul> | Crucial |
| Manipulator configuration |<ul><li>Kinematics of the manipulator, number of actuators, end effectors, etc.</li><li>Use semantic groups to define the different manipulator parts such as arm and end effector</li></ul> | Crucial |
| Motion planning | <ul><li> Ability to request a motion planning for the manipulator given different kinds of inputs. </li><li> Generate information from O3DE simulation about the state of the movable parts </li><li>Handle self collisions among the manipulator parts</li></ul> | Crucial |
| Motion execution |<ul><li> Successfully apply techniques of motion execution (controllers) to a O3DE simulation</li><li> Capacity to interact with third party libraries providing controllers </li><li> Interface to develop native controllers inside O3DE </li><li> Receive and execute trajectories generated by third party planners</li></ul> | Crucial |
| Input system | <ul><li>Basic input for an end effector in the form of a 6D Pose (position + orientation).</li><li>Consider other inputs based only in the position or orientation<li><li>Support goals based on the position/angle of each joint in the manipulator</li></ul> | Crucial |
| Multirobot collaborative manipulation | <ul><li>Use multiple robot for manipulation</li></ul> | Optional |
